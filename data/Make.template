#	Global makefile for all ivy subdirectorys

# Copyright 1990 Steven P. Reiss, Brown University - All rights reserved.
#
#
#	This file is used by gmake (gnu-make) as the primary makefile
#	when building any of the binary directorys of bwe.  The file
#	Make.pass in this directory is used in source directorys.  A
#	make in the source directory generally does:
#		cd ../bin.$(ARCH)
#		$(MAKE) ../../data/Make.template VPATH=../src $@
#			SRCDIR=`pwd` ARCH=<arch>
#	giving this makefile control in the proper binary directory.
#	This makefile in turn includes the file
#		../src/Make.data
#	from the source directory to get definitions for the actual
#	make.
#
#	The following should be defined in the Make.data file:
#		PACKAGE -- package name
#		HFILES --  common header files
#	The following may optionally be defined:
#		SFILES --  Original source files (listings, etc)
#		BFILES --  Binary files
#
